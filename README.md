# Responsive Contact Form

## Overview
This project is a responsive contact form inspired by the tutorial from CodingLab's ["Responsive Contact Us Form In HTML And CSS" video](https://youtu.be/6REjG1s6Z8k?si=sDMkTw5bjh0mRJ8C). While the format closely follows the instructions provided by CodingLab, the implementation has been enhanced with best practices in HTML and CSS as taught by Dave Gray. This includes lessons from videos such as ["HTML Forms and Inputs"](https://youtu.be/frAGrGN00OA?si=Yah6tfmKK-tWK_Ow), ["Semantic HTML Tags"](https://youtu.be/kX3TfdUqpuU?si=raCXa60FDQda7Lfh), ["How to Organize CSS"](https://youtu.be/MNPdifWAAa4?si=KpREUQbe55b5x62j), and ["CSS Custom Variables"](https://youtu.be/K_M7D0PfOFM?si=rFq4Hpgv0hDrUsU0).

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the contact form is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Semantic HTML**: Utilizes semantic HTML tags for improved accessibility and SEO.
- **Organized CSS**: Adopts the BEM methodology for CSS class naming and organization for easier maintenance and scalability.
- **CSS Custom Variables**: Implements CSS custom properties for a more dynamic and flexible styling approach.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- BEM Naming Convention
